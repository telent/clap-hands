* DONE plot individual weight points only when zoomed in
* DONE plot fat points as dots
* on-screen toggles to show/hide lines, points
* delete measure, unassign measure
* DONE emulate withings mouseover behaviour
  - show closest measure to wherever the mouse is, not just when over a dot
* figure out why we have to reauth to withings so often
* refresh button, visual indicator of last refresh time
  - sometimes weighins take a while to appear on the page
